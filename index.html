                            late; black and blue. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. Everything's not great in life, but
                            we can still find beauty in it. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting.
                            This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy.
                            <br> Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. This is an example
                            of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart.
                            That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. It's almost like
                            something out of a fairytale book.
                            <br> Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. Let's have a little
                            bit of fun today. It's cold, but it's beautiful.</p>
